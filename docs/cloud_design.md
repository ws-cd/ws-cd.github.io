{: .no_toc .header }

PromptDialog provides a dialog flow editing tool.  The cloud version allows you access the design anytime and anywhere. A designer can create/edit/upload dialog flows that reflect business logic and get them tested immediately.

The editing environment offers a low-code user interface, enabling you to quickly design and configure FAQ and multi-turn conversations. You can utilize a range of tools and features to define conversation flows, set response logic, manage intents and entities, etc.  Whether you're developing new dialogue flows or optimizing existing ones, our editing environment will help.

<!-- Upon the completion of editing, PromptDialog allows you to deploy the model to run in your own environment. This provides you with greater flexibility and control, enabling customization and integration of the chatbot with your existing systems. You can run the model in a local environment, achieving faster response times and maintaining data privacy. -->
