When we are doing entity recognition to fill slots, sometimes the name of entities can be predefined. In this case, a dictionary can facilitate entity recognition. 

## Add a dictionary
Here we add a dictionary to the slot `State Name`. The dictionary of US states can be described as follows:

```text
Alabama
Alaska
Arizona
Arkansas
California
Colorado
Connecticut
Delaware
Florida
Georgia
...
```
Click the `Upload` button behind the `State Name`, and upload the dictionary.

After uploading successfully, you can click `detail` to check which dictionary has been uploaded successfully, or you can `download` to check the dictionary.

## An example
Suppose we create a dialog flow diagram ''where are you from?''.

1. Add user utterance nodes as follows:
   
   ![dict-04](/assets/images/tutorial/dict/dict-04.png)
   
   `Note`: In order to improve the recognition accuracy of a dictionary, at least two examples need to be marked here.
2. When the state name is mentioned by the user and extracted successfully, the bot can reply as follows:
   
   ![dict-05](/assets/images/tutorial/dict/dict-05.png)
