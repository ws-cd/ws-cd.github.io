A typical application often has a dialog flow and FAQ mixed together: When a user is filling a form, she might ask a few questions.  By default, PromptDialog can interleave these two processes together.  During the stage of debugging and releasing, the designer can select both modules and compile them together.

We combine a dialog flow with FAQ and train them together:

When the bot runs,  it follows the dialog flow.  Meanwhile, it can answer questions in FAQ.
